# pingApp
This is a simple Django Web Application that allows you to ping multiple hosts at once to check whether they are up and running or not.
You must have Python and Django installed on your system. As an example, I added 3 hosts, but you can change them by modifying the addresses list in mainApp/views.py file.
To run the application:
Browse to the project folder in your terminal and type:
python manage.py runserver
